    <h1>About StudyWorld</h1>
    <p>
      StudyWorld began as a simple idea: make studying feel less like a chore and more like an adventure. 
      We believe productivity doesn’t have to mean burnout — it can be fun, rewarding, and maybe even a little competitive.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      To make studying feel less like punishment and more like progress—helping students stay
      motivated, connected, and confident in their goals.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
    Founded in 2025 by students who were tired of the “grind culture,” 
    StudyWorld started as a small experiment — part game, part study app, 
    part rebellion against academic burnout. Backed by research in motivation 
    and cognitive psychology, it rethinks how students focus, rest, and grow, turning 
    productivity into something sustainable. Now it’s growing into a platform where learning 
    meets creativity, and where your goals actually matter.
    </p>

    <h2>The Team</h2>
    <p>
      We’re a small, caffeine-fueled group of developers, designers, and dreamers who care about helping you 
      make the most of your time — without losing your sanity in the process.
    </p>

    <h2>What’s Next</h2>
    <p>
      Expect expansions: new maps, new features, new ways to learn. 
      StudyWorld is still evolving — just like the people using it.
